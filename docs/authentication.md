# Authentication

How `opencode-go-multi-auth` authenticates with OpenCode's Go subscription tier.

---

## Overview

OpenCode's Go subscription uses **API key authentication**. Each Go account comes with a unique API key that you generate from the OpenCode dashboard.

This plugin stores multiple Go API keys and presents one of them to OpenCode at session start. OpenCode then uses that key for all API calls during the session (completions, embeddings, etc.).

---

## Getting Go API Keys

1. Open [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth) in your browser.
2. Sign in with your Go subscription account.
3. Click **Generate API Key** (or the equivalent button).
4. Copy the displayed API key — it looks like `go_xxxxxxxxxxxx`.
5. Repeat for each Go subscription you want to use.

Each key is tied to a specific Go subscription and its associated quota.

## Adding an Account

### Via OpenCode Auth Settings

1. Open OpenCode.
2. Go to **Settings → Auth** (or open the command palette and type "Auth").
3. Find the "Go Multi-Auth" provider section.
4. Click **Add Go Account**.
5. Paste your Go API key when prompted.
6. Optionally enter a label (e.g. "Work", "Personal") to identify the account later.
7. Confirm — you'll see a success response.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you submit the API key:

1. The plugin reads the current accounts from `~/.config/opencode/opencode-go-accounts.json`.
2. It appends the new account with `enabled: true` and the current timestamp.
3. If this is the **first account** ever added, it sets `rotationIndex: 0` (marking it active).
4. It writes the updated accounts file atomically (tmp file + rename).
5. It **immediately syncs** the new key to OpenCode's internal auth store via `authClient.auth.set()` — this is critical because OpenCode only activates the plugin's `loader()` when the auth store has a value for the `"opencode"` provider.

> **Important:** The first account you add is special — it "primes" OpenCode's auth store so the plugin's loader actually fires on subsequent sessions. If you remove all accounts, the loader stops running until you add one again.

## The Auth Provider Flow

OpenCode's plugin system uses this lifecycle:

```
Session Start
  │
  ▼
Auth Store Check ─── Empty ──▶ Skip loader, use default auth
  │
  Non-empty
  │
  ▼
Plugin loader() called
  │
  ▼
  │
  ├── loadAccounts() from disk
  ├── pick next account (round-robin)
  ├── sync selected key to auth store
  ├── create rotating fetch interceptor
  │
  ▼
Return { apiKey, fetch } to OpenCode
  │
  ▼
OpenCode uses returned fetch for all API calls
```

### The Auth Store Gate

This is the single most important detail of the plugin: **the loader function only runs when OpenCode's auth store has a value for the `"opencode"` provider** (implemented in `provider.ts:1076`).

The code looks like:

```ts
// Inside OpenCode's provider.ts (simplified)
for (const hook of authHooks) {
  const auth = await authClient.auth.get({ path: { id: "opencode" } })
  if (!auth) continue  // ← skips the plugin entirely
  // ... calls plugin loader()
}
```

That's why `Add Go Account` calls `authClient.auth.set()` — it ensures the gate stays open. The `loader()` then calls `auth.set()` again with the **selected** account's key, keeping the gate open for the next session.

---

## How OpenCode Gets the API Key

The `loader()` returns:

```ts
return {
  apiKey: "",
  async fetch(input, init) {
    return rotatingFetch(input, init)  // wraps with auth header
  },
}
```

OpenCode uses the returned `fetch` function as a drop-in replacement for `globalThis.fetch`. Every API call from OpenCode goes through this interceptor, which attaches the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.

The `apiKey` field is deliberately left empty because OpenCode uses the returned `fetch` rather than reading `apiKey` directly (at least for the Go provider).

## Troubleshooting

**"No Go accounts configured"**
→ You haven't added any accounts yet. Run `Add Go Account` from the command palette.

**OpenCode shows a different auth provider**
→ The plugin only activates for the `"opencode"` provider. If OpenCode is set to Anthropic or another provider, the plugin's loader won't run.

**Auth method doesn't appear in the palette**
→ Make sure the plugin is installed globally: `opencode plugin list` should show it.

**Loader doesn't fire after adding first account**
→ After adding your first account via `Add Go Account`, the key is synced to the auth store. Restart OpenCode (quit and reopen) for the loader to activate on the new session.
